abstract: We submitted our partner age distribution modelling paper to eLife on 11 March. There are two big headlines. Sinh-arcsinh distributions fit to partner age distribution better than any of the other options we tested "Distributional" regression allowed us to share strength across respondents without sacrificing fit The attached plot shows how the inferred distributional parameters vary across respondent age and sex. The exciting part is that the DHS doesn't collect partner age data on people aged 50 years and old, so the older ages for the Haitian DHS are completely extrapolated.
