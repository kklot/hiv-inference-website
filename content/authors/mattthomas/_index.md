Matthew Thomas a Research Associate in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. His research interests are spatial and spatio-temporal statistics and the implementation of Bayesian hierarchical models with applications in the environment and public health. Prior to joining Imperial, Matthew's PhD research involved developing Bayesian hierarchical models to integrate data from multiple and disparate sources to estimate global air quality and the associated burden of disease. Matthew's current projects include estimating district-level circumcision rates and prevalence by age and time in South Africa and modelling facility-level attendance for anti-retroviral treatment in Malawi.
