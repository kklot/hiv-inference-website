Tim Wolock is a PhD student in Statistics in the Mathematics Department at Imperial College London supervised by Seth Flaxman and Jeff Eaton. His research focuses on developing novel statistical methods that facilitate robust, informative inference for public health applications. He is particularly interested in the use of multivariate modelling (*i.e.* modelling multiple response variables simultaneously) as a way to robustly synthesise diverse data sources in social scientific settings.

Previously, he worked as a Post-Bachelor Fellow at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, where he modelled HIV for the Global Burden of Disease Study, and as a Senior Data Analyst at PayScale, a compensation software company, studying the dynamics of employee compensation and satisfaction. His PhD thesis is focusing on developing methods needed to infer population-level adult HIV incidence over space and time simultaneously from sparse measurements of a diverse set of indicators.
