Jeff Eaton is a Senior Lecturer in HIV Epidemiology in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. His research interests involve developing new mathematical models, statistical methods, and surveillance tools to characterize HIV epidemic trends, transmission dynamics, and the demographic impacts of HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa.

He co-chairs the [UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections](www.epidem.org) which provides guidance to UNAIDS and partner organizations on  the data, methods and tools that underpin global HIV estimates published by UNAIDS. He has a longstanding interest in the collection and analysis of longitudinal HIV data and is a co-investigator of the [ALPHA Network](https://alpha.lshtm.ac.uk/) of general population HIV cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa.
